Overview
The ECG heartbeat classification model is trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which contains ECG recordings with annotations for different types of arrhythmias. The model uses a combination of feature extraction with scikit-learn and deep learning with Keras to classify each heartbeat into one of five classes:
